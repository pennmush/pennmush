Version 1.8.4 patchlevel 0                                 May 09,  2010

Major Changes:
 * Commands can now be restricted with an @lock-style lock in restrict.cnf
   and @command/restrict, allowing more complex restrictions. [MG]

Minor Changes:
 * @shutdown/reboot logs who was responsible. Suggested by Kitai. [SW]
 * Rewrite of help @lock to improve clarity, by Sketch.
 * New NO_LOG flag to disable command logging on a per-object basis.
   Based on code by Teal. [SW]
 * mindb+maxdb classes for lsearch/@search no longer reset to default
   values when > db_top or < 0 is given: Instead treated as an integer
   comparison. [GM]
 * @open can now open exits in remove locations, as well as your current
   location. Suggested by Bane. [MG]
 * New OPEN_OK flag allows anyone to open exits in a room, and @lock/open
   to restrict who can. Based on patch by ranmir@M*U*S*H. [MG]
 * Master Room exits and ZMR exits now run the "goto" command, and @ealias
   and @lalias run the "enter"/"leave" commands, so @hooks get run, command
   restrictions checked, etc. [MG]
 * New @lock/from and @lock/receive locks, to control who can give to an
   object, and what objects can be given to them, respectively. From a 
   suggestion by Nammyung@M*U*S*H, based on locks on ElendorMUSH. [MG]
 * Changed the restrictions for valid @function names to match what was
   reported by valid(). [MG]

Commands:
 * New @include <obj>/<attr> command, which inserts <attr> into the current
   action list. Patch by Javelin.
 * @scan can now take multiple switches at the same time. [MG]
 * @version now reports the SVN revision of the current version, when 
   available. Suggested by Paige. [MG]
 * @clone can take a garbage dbref for the new object, the same as @create.
   Suggested by Dan. [MG]
 * 'look' now supports more english-matching (look this foo's 1st bar). [MG]
 * You can now look at objects on the other side of transparent exits, with
   "look [toward] <exit>'s <object>". Suggested by Trinsec. [MG]
 * All wizards can now use @command/add. Suggested by qa'toq. [MG]
 * function_alias in alias.cnf now creates a proper alias, not a clone, of
   functions. @function/alias added, which does the same in-game. [MG]
 * New @command/clone and @function/clone commands, which create copies of
   a command/function which initially work the same as, but are independant
   of, the originals. Based on suggestion by Bane. [MG]
 * Added a comment line to the beginning of @decompile's output showing
   the object name and dbref. [MG]
   
Functions:
 * Added strfirstof() and strallof(), which return the first arg/all args
   which are non-empty strings. [MG]
 * Added reglattr[p](), regxattr[p]() and regnattr[p](), regexp variants of 
   lattr[p](), xattr[p]() and nattr[p](). Suggested by Trinsec. [MG]
 * The *emit() functions, and cbufferadd(), are now disabled when
   function_side_effects are off. Suggested by Cheetah. [MG]
 * round() now takes an optional third argument to 0-pad the results if
   needed. Suggested by Trinsec. [SW]
 * Many functions (particularly ones which take only numbers, dbrefs or
   attribute names as arguments) now ignore ANSI in their arguments, rather
   than throwing an error. [MG]
 * nattr()'s <attribute pattern> now defaults to *, not **, the same as
   lattr() and other attribute functions. [MG]
 * clone() can now take a <new name> and <dbref>, as per @clone. [MG]
 * cwho() now takes an optional 3rd argument to omit gagged objects.
   Suggested by Trinsec. [MG]

Attributes:
 * @outpageformat lets you alter how you view pages that you send.

Fixes:
 * isprint() bug in ord() fixed. [GM]
 * Possible crashbug in @destroy fixed. Reported by Dan. [MG]
 * Minor bug in benchmark() fixed. [MG]
 * channels(<object>) was incorrectly sorted for channel names containing
   ansi. Reported by Trelane. [MG]
 * Help fixes by Teal and others. [MG]
 * Minor updates to some README files. [MG]
 * Some typos and translation errors fixed by Stoko.
 * namelist() now ignores null items. Reported by Minion. [MG]
 * The matching code would always perform absolute (dbref) matches, even
   when it wasn't told to. [MG]
 * Improvements to the match flags used by many pieces of code, hopefully
   fixing a number of minor bugs. [MG]
 * Paranoid dumps no longer treat ANSI tags as invalid characters in attrs.
   Reported by Trelane. [MG]
 * The /silent switch for @lemit didn't work. [MG]
 * @decompile/db showed '@create <dbref>' for THINGs, not '@create <name>',
   and @decomp/name could break. Reported by Paige. [MG]
 * Crash bug in locks fixed. Reported by Tanaku. [SW]
