==========================================================================

Version 1.8.6 patchlevel 0                                 ?? ??, 201?

NOTE: When updating from an earlier version of PennMUSH, you'll need to run 'make update' and './config.status' in the toplevel PennMUSH directory prior to running 'make'.

Major changes:
 * Hosted on Github. Thanks, Google. [DC]

Functions:
 * element() is now an alias for match(). Suggested by Wiggles. [985-TK]
 * Added json(), for creating valid JSON-encoded data. [MG]
 * Added oob(), for sending out-of-band messages via the General MUD Communication Protocol (GMCP) telnet option. Requested by Qon. [MG]
 * registers() only listed registers whose values were strings, not ints. [MG]
 * filter() and filterbool() can now be passed additional arguments, for Rhost compatability. Requested by Volund. [1019-MG] [Rhost]
 * valid() can now validate timezones, locktypes and lockkeys. Suggested by Volund. [1021,1025-MG]
 * convtime() now returns #-1, instead of -1, on error. This change is -backwards incompatible-, but necessary as -1 is a potentially valid output for convtime(). Suggested by KimikoMuffin. [1010-MG]
 * convsecs() can now accept negative inputs when Extended convtime() is available. Suggested by Volund. [1010-MG]
 * avg() is now an alias for mean(). [1023-TK] [Rhost]
 * textsearch() allows searching the contents of helpfiles. [MG]
 * speak() no longer has the odd TinyMUSH behaviour of ': foo' being a semipose; speakpenn() is now an exact alias. [1034-MG]
 * timefmt() and isdaylight() can now take a negative number of seconds for times prior to 1970 when Extended Convtime is available. [MG]
 * colors(...,auto) returns colors in the same style as their input. Suggested by Kimiko. [MG]
 * rjust(str,X,,1) truncated the end of the string, instead of the start. [MG]
 * Minor json() bug and documentation fixes. [MG]
 * wordpos() is now ansi-aware. [MG]
 * More markup-awareness in a number of list functions. [MG]

Commands:
 * The 'kill' and 'slay' commands have been removed. [1033-TK]
 * Remove ancient @channel foo=on behavior. Reported by Paige. [870-TK]
 * @logwipe can do more than just erasing a log file. [SW]
 * @hooks now have a number of named registers (available through r(<name>,args)) with each of the hooked command's arguments. [MG]
 * Added @if and @skip. [MG] [Rhost] [MUX]
 * help/search <pattern> lets you search within helpfiles. [MG] [Rhost]

Minor changes:
 * The 'HAVEN' flag can now only be set on players. [1033-TK]
 * Added a few more date formats to getdate.template for convtime(). Suggested by Volund and Mercutio. [1020-MG]
 * Most PennMUSH helpfiles are no longer hard-wrapped at 78 characters; noone connects from clients that can't wrap any more. [1030-MG]
 * Other minor help fixes. [MG]
 * Attempting to run an empty SQL query via any command/function now gives a better error/return value. Reported by Qon. [MG]
 * Added some tests for json(), and more tests for ljust()/rjust(). [MG]
 * Guests can no longer @channel/recall channels they aren't on. [MG]
 * The hardcode no longer strictly enforces permissions for @wall, @rwall or @wizwall; anyone who can passes the normal command restriction can now use them. [MG]
   
Hardcode:
 * queue_event() is now a macro to queue_event_internal() which takes an additional argument of a custom event handler. PR by Qon.

 * Added support for the General MUD Communication Protocol (GMCP). See http://www.gammon.com.au/gmcp for more info. Requested by Qon. [MG]
