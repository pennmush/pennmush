Version 1.8.7 patchlevel 0 ??? ?? 20??
======================================

Major Changes
-------------

* Support websocket connections. See
  <https://github.com/grapenut/websockclient> for a sample in-browser
  client. [Grapenut, 1007]
* Change attributes from being stored in sorted linked lists to sorted
  arrays; results in faster lookups and less memory usage. [SW]

Minor Changes
-------------

* Message translation support now defaults to off. Run configure with `--enable-nls` to turn it on if needed. [SW]
* Shrink the NEW_PE_INFO struct, for signficant memory savings in softcode that queues lots of commands. [SW]

Softcode
--------

* Support all of Rhost's colors() key arguments (Except n). [SW, 1112]
* Functions that work on integers (Like div() or band()) now use 64-bit values instead of 32-bit. [SW]
* json_query() get and exists can follow paths into objects instead of taking a single key/index. Suggested by qa'toq. [SW]
* json_query(str, unescape) handles unicode escape sequences.
* json(string, foo) escapes non-ascii characters.
* owner() now accepts two optional arguments for changing ownership as in @chown and @atrchown. PR by Qon. 

Fixes
-----

* A bunch of color names weren't mapping correctly to Xterm color codes. [SW]
* `@grep/iprint` hilites the matching text in the same case it appears in the attribute body. [SW, 1120]
* `@mail` wasn't updating a player's MAILCURF attribute correctly. [CLDawes, 1131]
* Connecting with a web browser to a mush without a mud_url config option set caused an infinite refresh loop. Reported by grapenut. [1149]
* Make sure sigrecv_ack() won't hang the mush if it somehow gets called at the wrong time. Also fix a file descriptor leak in the signal handling code. [SW]
* Pass pe_info into IDLE and HAVEN attributes from the page command. [MG]
* The x and X options to align() now always truncate to the column width, rather than incorrectly truncating at a space. Reported by Qon. [MG, 1178]
* json_query() didn't understand an action of 'type' as documented. [SW]
* Assorted help file fixes. [SW]

Documentation
-------------

* Changelogs and other documentation use markup. [SW, 1140]
* Start trying to clean up and revise ancient documentation. [1095]

OS Specific
-----------

### BSDs in general ###

* info_slave and ssl_slave use kqueue() to efficiently be notified of parent mush crashes.

### OpenBSD ###

* netmush and slave processes use pledge(2) to limit their privileges. [SW]

### Windows ###

* Use Windows crypto library functions for base64 conversion and digest hashing instead of OpenSSL. [SW]
