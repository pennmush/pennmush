 * II. License
 *
 * Because PennMUSH includes parts of multiple works, you must comply
 * with all of the relevant licenses of those works. The portions derived
 * from TinyMUD/TinyMUSH 2.0 are licensed under the following terms:
 *
 *   Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
 *   modification, are permitted provided that: (1) source code distributions
 *   retain the above copyright notice and this paragraph in its entirety, and

 * 
 *   THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 *   WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 *   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 *
 * Although not necessary given the above copyright, the TinyMUSH 2.0
 * developers, Joseph Traub and Glenn Crocker, confirmed in email to
 * Alan Schwartz in 2002 that they were willing to have any of their
 * code present in PennMUSH redistributed under the Artistic License.
 *
 * The portions derived from TinyMUSH 2.2 are used under the Artistic
 * License. Jean Marie Diaz, Lydia Leong, and Devin Hooker, the
 * TinyMUSH 2.2 copyright holders, explicitly agreed to relicense
 * their source code under the Artistic License in 2002, and TinyMUSH 2.2.5
 * was released under this license; Alan Schwartz has confirmatory email 
 * from them authorizing the redistribution of any portions of TinyMUSH 2.2
 * that may be present in PennMUSH under the Artistic License. 
 *
 * The Artistic License is also the license under which you
 * are granted permission to copy, modify, and redistribute PennMUSH:
 *
 * The Artistic License
 * 
 * Preamble
 * 
 * The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 * Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 * semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 * while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 * the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
 * reasonable modifications.
 * 
 * Definitions:
 * 
 * "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
 * Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through
 * textual modification.
 * "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
 * or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright
 * Holder.
 * "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights
 * for the package.
 * "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
 * "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
 * cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will
 * not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the
 * computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
 * "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
 * though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
 * that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions
 * they received it.
 * 
 * 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
 * Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
 * you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
 * disclaimers.
 * 
 * 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 * derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
 * modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 * 
 * 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
 * that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
 * when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of
 * the following:
 * 
 *  a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
 *  Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
 *  equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
 *  such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
 *  modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 * 
 *  b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 * 
 *  c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
 *  standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
 *  manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how
 *  it differs from the Standard Version.
 * 
 *  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 * 
 * 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 * executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 * 
 *  a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
 *  together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
 *  to get the Standard Version.
 * 
 *  b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
 *  Package with your modifications.
 * 
 *  c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
 *  Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
 *  non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual
 *  pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the
 *  Standard Version.
 * 
 *  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 * 
 * 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
 * this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
 * Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you
 * may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
 * programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
 * provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.
 * 
 * 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
 * output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under
 * the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them,
 * and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
 * 
 * 7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
 * shall not be considered part of this Package.
 * 
 * 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
 * promote products derived from this software without specific prior
 * written permission.
 * 
 * 9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 * WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 * MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 * The End

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
