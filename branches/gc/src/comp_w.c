 * \brief Word-based compression.
 *
 * Table-lookup (word) compress, written by Nick Gammon. 21/Oct/95.
 *
 * This method maintains a table of 32768 words, where a "word" is defined
 * as a sequence of alpha or numeric characters (such as "dog123").
 *
 * Compression
 * -----------
 *
 * The text to be compressed is broken up into "words" and other symbols
 * (e.g. commas, brackets, spaces and so on).
 *
 * Words are looked up in the word table by using a hash-table lookup. If
 * found, the "index" into the table is emitted with the high order bit set.
 * If not found, the word is added to the table, and is then emitted as
 * described above.
 *
 * For example: "The dog and the other dog sat on the mat (eating fish)."
 * would compress as:
 *
 * 0x8001      The
 * 0x8002      dog
 * 0x8003      and
 * 0x8004      the
 * 0x8005      other
 * 0x8002      dog
 * 0x8007      sat
 * 0x8008      on
 * 0x8004      the
 * 0x8009      mat
 * 0x28        (
 * 0x800A      eating
 * 0x800B      fish)
 * 0x2E        .
 *
 * In the above example, the uncompressed text is 55 bytes, and the compressed 
 * text is 26 bytes.
 *
 * For simplicity, the above example assumes that the words hash to consecutive
 * table positions.
 *
 * Note that the trailing punctuation character (space, period or whatever) is 
 * considered _part_ of the word. This is to save having to store multiple 
 * spaces between each word, and is relying on the fact that a certain word is
 * usually followed by the same punctuation. For example, the word "and" would
 * normally be followed by a space.
 *
 * In the above example, the space following "mat" is stored in the table, and
 * thus the "(" character had to be output separately. The ")" following the
 * word "fish" is considered part of the word and is stored in the table, 
 * however the last period was output as a separate character.
 *
 * Note how the high-order bit is turned on for words in the table, this is so
 * the decompression routine can detect table lookup characters from ordinary
 * ones. Also, any table index with a low-order byte of zero cannot be used,
 * as this would cause the resulting "string" to be prematurely truncated (by
 * strcpy, strcmp etc.). Thus the lookup routine skips any positions that hash
 * to the value 0xXX00. (There are only 256 such indices).
 *
 * Also, to prevent characters which the user might type in with the high order
 * bit set causing decompression confusion, all text is stripped of its high
 * order bit before being added to the table or emitted.
 *
 * In the event of two words hashing to the same value, the compression routine
 * scans forwards for COLLISION_LIMIT entries, looking for a match or a spare
 * table entry. If none is found, the word is output "as is" (i.e.
 * uncompressed). You might speed up compression slightly by lowering
 * COLLISION_LIMIT, at the cost of slightly lower compression ratios. 
 *
 * The collision limit does not affect _decompression_ as that merely involves
 * a direct table lookup.
 *
 * Decompression
 * -------------
 *
 * Decompression involves a simple loop, in which each byte of the compressed
 * text is examined. If it has the high-order bit clear, it is just emitted.
 * If the high order bit is set it, along with the next byte in the compressed
 * text, are used to index into the word lookup table. The word found there is
 * then emitted.
 *
 * Speed
 * -----
 *
 * Tests conducted on (hopefully typical) text show that decompression is about
 * 4 times as fast as Huffman decompression.
 *
 * Compression however is about 3.5 times as _slow_ as Huffman compression.
 *
 * The slower compression time is considered acceptable on the grounds that
 * text is much more often _decompressed_ in a MUSH than compressed. Compression
 * mainly takes part at database load time (say, once a week) whereas 
 * decompression take part every hour, as the database is dumped to disk, and
 * whenever an object description is displayed, or an attribute searched for,
 *
 * Compression ratio
 * -----------------
 *
 * The "table compression" method has a poor compression ratio for small amounts
 * of text, because of the overhead of the 32768 pointers, and the data stored
 * in them. However, as the database size increases, the ratio improves because
 * the table overhead becomes progressively less significant.
 *
 * The break-even points is with about 1.5 Mb of text, where both the table 
 * compression and Huffman compress to about 63% of the size of the original.
 *
 * After that, the compression ratio gradually improves until reaching somewhere
 * between 40% and 50% of the size of the original, as the amount of text to
 * compress reaches 10 Mb.
 *
 * The nature of Huffman compression however is such that it will always be 
 * fixed at about 63% regardless of the amount of data compressed.
