Version 1.8.5 patchlevel 0                                 Feb 12, 2012

Major changes:
 * The PCRE library is now required to build Penn, instead of falling
   back to an old, buggy version formerly bundled with the MUSH. [SW]
   Daniko assisted greatly with Windows changes and documentation.
 * The OpenSSL library is now required to build Penn. Again, Daniko has
   provided instructions for installing on Windows. [SW]
 * A new command prefix, "}", enables debug for a single execution of the
   command  - }think foo, }+who, etc. See 'help }' for more info. Suggested
   by Wiggles and [GM]. [MG]

Minor changes:
 * Added a new event, OBJECT`FLAG, triggered when a flag/power with the
   "event" restriction is set or cleared. Suggested by [SW]. [MG]
 * Expanded help on lock types and @powers. [MG]
 * @startups are now processed in db order (#0, #1, etc) on reboot instead
   of giving priority to player objects. [MG]
 * @startups (and local_startup() in local.c) are now triggered slightly
   later, ensuring that the db is fully loaded, and that the connected player
   list is loaded on @shutdown/reboot. Suggested by Padraic. [MG]
 * Switch names that are defined but not used by any commands are
   warned about on startup, and several unused ones have been removed
   from the master list. [SW]
 * Tweak utils/mkcmds.pl for the above change and to remove references
   to generating the obsolete patches.h. [SW]
 * Tweak the parameters of the skip list used to store memcheck counts
   to save some memory. [SW]
 * Bring the scheme scripts in utils up to date with current versions
   of chicken scheme (The implementation of the language they're
   written for.) [SW]
 * The test harness code strips trailing whitespace before attempting to match
   against expected results, making it easier to use bounded regexps. [SW]
 * @destination (for variable exits) is now a standard attribute, and has
   a helpfile. [MG]
 * Sound is now propagated through audible variable exits, and exits @linked
   to 'home'. Suggested by Mercutio. [SW]
 * The internal QUEUE attribute is no longer used to track the number
   of action lists an object has queued; the objdata system is used
   instead.  [SW]
 * isobjid() now requires a full object id (with :ctime), and will return 0
   for simple dbrefs, or objids of destroyed/invalid objects. isdbref() still
   matches both dbrefs and objids. Suggested by Covenent. [MG]
 * @entrances and entrances() now use the same internal routines as @search,
   and have similar (and saner) privs. From a suggestion by Sketch. [MG]
 * Connection messages that are evaluated from an attribute instead of
   read from a file get the dbref of the connected player as %1, as
   long as they're ones shown post-connection (motd_file, etc.) [SW]
 * Passwords are, thanks to OpenSSL digest routines, now stored in a
   less error prone, more secure, flexible and extendable
   format. Existing player passwords will be upgraded automatically on
   login. [SW]
 * New script in utils/ for manipulating player passwords in an offline
   database. Useful if you forget God's password. [SW]
 * The my_vsnprintf function in the hardcode has been renamed to
   mush_vsnprintf to avoid a conflict with MySQL. Reported by Balerion @ 
   Blood of Dragons. [MG]
 * The enactor (%#) for the PLAYER`DISCONNECT event is now more useful,
   instead of always being set to the dbref of the player disconnecting (%0).
   Suggested by Padraic. [MG]
 * The SOCKET`LOGINFAIL event now gets passed the name that was entered as
   %5 when no matching player is found. Suggested by Daniel Powell. [MG]

Commands:
 * Added @mail/review for reading mail you've sent, and @mail/retract for
   deleting unread mail that you sent. Idea from MUX. Patch by Minion.
 * @hook/list now shows error messages if you don't have permission to use
   it, or if a command has no hooks, instead of failing silently. Suggested
   by Padraic. [MG]
 * Wizards can now @pcreate players with restricted names, as well as being
   able to rename existing players to forbidden names. Suggested by Nymeria @
   Blood of Dragons. [MG]

Functions:
 * Functions that take a sort type argument now accept 'mtime' for
   sorting based on object's modification time. Patch by Minion.
 * New registers() function, like listq() but returns all kinds of registers
   (q-registers, %0-%9 args, iter/switch context, regexp captures). Also
   takes an output separator arg. Suggested by Wiggles. [MG]
 * digest(list) returns all message digest algorithms the server supports. [SW]
 * sha0() has been deprecated in favor of digest(). [SW]

Fixes:
 * lit() didn't properly handle '\'s. Reported by Wiggles. [MG]
 * listq() incorrectly returned all registers (including %0-%9, %i0, etc),
   not just %q-registers. Reported by Wiggles. [MG]
 * The mud_url code didn't always work correctly in Firefox because http
   headers weren't sent. [MG]
 * %0 and %1 arguments weren't properly passed through verb attributes after
   a change in p8. Reported by Padraic. [MG]
 * Fix really stupid copy-and-paste error in magic sorts on strings with
   ANSI, which broke setinter() and friends. Reported by Minion. [MG]
 * Help fixes by Wiggles, Mouvar and others. [MG]
 * Memory leak in ldelete() fixed. [MG]
 * Fix a crashbug reported by Minion. [MG]
 * Sorting functions now ignore ANSI when sorting a string as a number
   or dbref. From report by Mouvar. [MG]
 * strreplace() was broken for overly long length arguments. Reported
   by Ashen-Shugar.  [SW]
 * Compile errors on Windows with OpenSSL. Reported by Daniko.
 * @uptime could report negative times for the first dump, purge, etc after
   a game was started. Reported by Cooee. [MG]
 * override/inplace hooks from .cnf files didn't work correctly. [MG]
 * The portmsg announcer daemon was broken. Reported by Minion. [SW]
 * A change in p8 broke the sending of the Pueblo hello string in some cases.
   Reported by Mercutio. [MG]
 * Fix crash bug in @sitelock/remove [SW]
 * ssl_slave would drop connections if it couldn't resolve a valid hostname
   for the connecting IP address. [SW]
 * Non-matching regexp captures ($0, $<foo>, etc) sometimes had the value
   of the previous matching capture. From a report by Sketch. [MG]
