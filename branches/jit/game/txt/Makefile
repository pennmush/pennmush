#
# This makefile only rebuilds the text files we need it
#
# By default we build help, news, and events.
# To build rules.txt:
#	add rules.txt to the TXT line
# Do the same to build index.txt (but add index.txt)

TXT=help.txt news.txt events.txt

# INDEX_FLAGS can be set to one or more of:
#  --first     Insert the first entry alias in the index
#  --longest   Insert the longest entry alias in the index
# If left blank, all aliases are indexed. This is the default behavior.
# (By default, this variable is not used in making the help index,
# but if you want it to be, you can figure out how from the examples
# below.)
