A note on install locations:
The entire process goes much more smoothly if you install
all of the required packages in directories that do not have
spaces anywhere in the path name. So Program Files is not
the best location. C:\cygwin is the usual default.

1. Download and run the Cygwin setup.exe from http://www.cygwin.com

2. During package selection, select the following packages in
   addition to the Base and other default selections:

   From Devel:
	binutils
	gcc
	gcc-core
	make
   From Libs, if you want SSL:
	openssl
	openssl-devel
   From Perl:
	perl
   From Shells:
	bash
   From Utils:
	gnupg 		if you want to to verify signatures on penn dists
	patch

   Accept all dependencies needed to install these packages.
	
3. Start a cygwin bash shell and use that for all the following steps.

4. `cd' to the desired install location with the .tar.gz file
   and unpack the downloaded <version> with:

    tar xzf pennmush-<version>.tar.gz

   Again, life is easier if your install location has no spaces
   in directory names. If your username has no spaces, unpacking
   in /home/yourname works fine.

5. cd pennmush then type:

    ./configure --disable-info_slave --disable-ipv6
    
    info_slave does not currently work on Windows, and many people have
    found that leaving ipv6 enabled results in noone being able to connect.
    You may also want --disable-sql if you're not planning to use SQL.
    See ./configure --help for all available options.

6. Now type:

    make update
    
   and choose the desired options.

7. Do a `make install' This will build the necessary files and
   install the necessary symbolic links. 

8. Read game/README and follow those instructions. 
   You may also need to edit game/restart and explicitly
   set the GAMEDIR variable to your installation path, though this is
   not normally necessary. An example is:
    
    /home/noltar/pennmush/game
