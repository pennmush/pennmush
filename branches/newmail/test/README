Regression tests for Penn functions and commands.

Usage:
        perl runtest.pl testFOO.pl ...

or     
        ./alltests.sh

The test*.pl files are frameworks for tests, not actual perl scripts.

Their format:

 login mortal
 expect N failures!
 run tests:
 perl code

All the lines above the 'run tests:' one are optional. 

Look at existing files for how to write tests. Some hints: $god is
always available as a test connection. If 'login mortal' was given,
$mortal is too.
