Major Changes:

* Support websocket connections. See https://github.com/grapenut/websockclient for a sample in-browser client. [Grapenut, 1007]
* Change attributes from being stored in sorted linked lists to sorted arrays; results in faster lookups and less memory usage. [SW]
* Penn now comes with the Sqlite3 database engine bundled with it, and uses it internally in a few ways:

* 3 different tables for looking up color names are combined into a single table.
* Per-object auxilliary data keys (objdata) are handled in sql.
* Player names and alias lists are handled in sql, making some operations on them simpler.
* Suggests alternatives for unknown function names, flags, powers and help entries, and a softcode interface to the suggestion engine.
* @entrances and entrances() no longer scan the entire database.
* Help files are stored in a database, with an expanded help/search that supports full text search. See [1mHELP SEARCHING[0m for details.
* Optional enhanced connection logging. See the file [1mgame/CONNLOG.md[0m for details.
* A number of new softcode functions and expanded functions, listed below.

Minor Changes:

* Message translation support now defaults to off. Run configure with [1m--enable-nls[0m to turn it on if needed. [SW]
* Shrink the [1mNEW_PE_INFO[0m struct, for signficant memory savings in softcode that queues lots of commands. [SW]
* Add more test cases to the softcode test suite. [SW]
* log_forces in mushcnf.dst now defaults to no. You probably only want this on if you‚Äôre debugging. [MG]
* The connect screen now respects SOCKSET options. [MG]
* @chan/what now displays channel locks. [MT, 1208]

Softcode:

* Support all of Rhost‚Äôs [1mcolors()[0m key arguments (Except n). [SW, 1112]
* Functions that work on integers (Like [1mdiv()[0m or [1mband()[0m) now use 64-bit values instead of 32-bit. [SW]
* Added [1misjson()[0m
* [1mjson_query()[0m get and exists can follow paths into objects instead of taking a single key/index. Suggested by qa‚Äôtoq. [SW]
* [1mjson_mod()[0m for modifying complex JSON objects. [SW]
* [1mjson_query(str, unescape)[0m handles unicode escape sequences.
* [1mjson(string, foo)[0m escapes non-ascii characters.
* [1mclone()[0m now takes an optional fourth argument to act like [1m@clone/preserve[0m [797]
* New ‚Äòme‚Äô and ‚Äòinventory‚Äô flags for [1mscan()[0m give finer control of what to scan. [MG]
* [1morflags()[0m, [1morlflags()[0m, [1mandflags()[0m, [1mandlflags()[0m, and the power versions no longer return errors on unknown flags/powers. They instead treat the unknown one as if it wasn‚Äôt set. Suggested by Qon. [1180].
* [1mtimecalc()[0m and [1msecscalc()[0m for adding/subtracting intervals from times.
* [1m@suggest[0m and [1msuggest()[0m for user-defined spellchecking. Loads [1m/usr/share/dict/words[0m or another configurable wordlist by default.
* [1mconnlog()[0m and [1mconnrecord()[0m for interfacing with enhanced connection logs.
* [1msoundex()[0m and [1msoundslike()[0m now support a second phonetic hash algorithm besides soundex.
* Side-effect version of [1mlink()[0m now returns 1 on success, 0 or #-1 on failure. [MT]
* [1mowner()[0m now accepts two optional arguments, allowing ownership to be changed as in [1m@chown[0m and [1m@atrchown[0m. [MT]
* If compiled with libcurl support, adds [1m@http[0m for interacting with RESTFul web APIs. [SW]
* [1mstripaccents()[0m supports a second, smarter, transliteration algorithm.
* If compiled with ICU support, adds [1mlcstr2()[0m and [1mucstr2()[0m with proper support for characters like the German eszett (√ü) that map to a different number of characters in different cases.
* [1m@chatformat[0m now receives a new arg, [1m%6[0m, which defaults to ‚Äúsays‚Äù but may be replaced by the speechtext mogrifier. Inspired by Bodin. [MG]
* [1metimefmt()[0m supports [1m$w[0m and [1m$y[0m formats for weeks and years. [SW, 804]

Fixes:

* A bunch of color names weren‚Äôt mapping correctly to Xterm color codes. [SW]
* [1m@grep/iprint[0m hilites the matching text in the same case it appears in the attribute body. [SW, 1120]
* [1m@mail[0m wasn‚Äôt updating a player‚Äôs MAILCURF attribute correctly. [CLDawes, 1131]
* Connecting with a web browser to a mush without a [1mmud_url[0m config option set caused an infinite refresh loop. Reported by grapenut. [1149]
* Make sure [1msigrecv_ack()[0m won‚Äôt hang the mush if it somehow gets called at the wrong time. Also fix a file descriptor leak in the signal handling code. [SW]
* Pass [1mpe_info[0m into IDLE and HAVEN attributes from the page command. [MG]

* [1m@clone[0m without /preserve wasn‚Äôt stripping privileged flags and such. [1190,SW]
* [1m@chown/preserve[0m was resetting wiz-bit despite it‚Äôs help file indicating otherwise. [1187] PR by Qon.
* [1mscan()[0m now determines if objects will be included based on whether the caller can examine them, rather than if [1mscan()[0m‚Äôs [1m<looker>[0m can examine them. [MG]
* Fixed some bugs regarding when [1msetq()[0m will and won‚Äôt let you set the values of named registers when you‚Äôve hit the limit. [MG, 1179]
* [1msqlescape()[0m when using a sqlite3 connection no longer also requires MySQL.
* A number of issues in the handling UTF-8 text sent by clients have been fixed, as well as improvements in UTF-8 handling in general. [SW]
* Fix an off-by-one error in command switch initialization code. [SW]

* Fix a long-standing bug where input sent right after a SSL connection could get lost. [SW]

Documentation:

* Changelogs and other documentation use markup. [SW, 1140]
* Start trying to clean up and revise ancient documentation. [1095]
* Help fixes and improvements. [MG, SW, MT]
* Help files are now in UTF-8.

OS Specific:

BSDs in general:

* [1minfo_slave[0m and [1mssl_slave[0m use [1mkqueue()[0m to efficiently be notified of parent mush crashes.

OpenBSD:

* netmush and slave processes use [1mpledge(2)[0m to limit their privileges. [SW]

Windows:

* Use Windows crypto library functions for base64 conversion and digest hashing instead of OpenSSL. [SW]
