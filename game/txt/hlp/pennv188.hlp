WARNING! With the removal of the object queue, please be careful when upgrading that you do not have any infinitely looping triggers without an @wait.


As an example, this used to be a common way to ensure something was executed once per second:


> &everysecond object=do some ; updates ; @trigger me/everysecond


This will now happen up to several thousand times per second! Add in an @wait 1, and it‚Äôll work as expected!


Major Changes:

* Built-in HTTP server support, see ‚Äúhelp http‚Äù [GM]
* A single command queue for players and objects. No more @trigger waits. [GM]
* A restructuring of bsd.c, to make it easier to reason about Penn‚Äôs queue cycle. [GM]
* Millisecond timing in bsd.c for polling waits in prep for subsecond @waits. [GM]

Minor Changes:

* Sockets commands now inline $-commands, so, e.g: $,* *: chat aliases don‚Äôt hit queue. [GM]
* Millisecond timing in bsd.c for polling waits in prep for subsecond @waits. [GM]
* Sqlite3‚Äôs [1mREGEXP[0m operator is always available and uses pcre regular expressions (Previously it depended on libicu and used java style REs). [SW]
* Update [1mlocal.dst[0m to include example of millisecond callback loop. [MT]
* Add ‚Äò‚Äìdisable-socket-quota‚Äô option for our test suite [GM]

Softcode:

* [1maddrlog()[0m for searching through list of unique IP addresses that have connected to a game. [SW]
* [1mconnlog()[0m can return just a count of matching records. [SW]
* [1mformdecode()[0m for decoding HTTP paths and POST bodies. [GM]
* [1m@respond[0m for manipulating HTTP response codes and headers. [GM]
* [1mhmac()[0m for creating authentication fingerprints. [SW]

Fixes:

* [1madd_function[0m in .cnf files was not properly using the upper case‚Äôd string. [#1223, MT]
* Various PCRE calls in the softcode have had CPU time limit watchdogs added. Discovered by Ashen-Shugar. [GM]
