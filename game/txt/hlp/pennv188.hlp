WARNING! With the removal of the object queue, please be careful when upgrading that you do not have any infinitely looping triggers without an @wait.


As an example, this used to be a common way to ensure something was executed once per second:


> &everysecond object=do some ; updates ; @trigger me/everysecond


This will now happen up to several thousand times per second! Add in an @wait 1, and it’ll work as expected!


Major Changes:

* Built-in HTTP server support, see “help http” [GM]
* A single command queue for players and objects. No more @trigger waits. [GM]
* A restructuring of bsd.c, to make it easier to reason about Penn’s queue cycle. [GM]
* Millisecond timing in bsd.c for polling waits in prep for subsecond @waits. [GM]

Minor Changes:

* Sockets commands now inline $-commands, so, e.g: $,* *: chat aliases don’t hit queue. [GM]
* Millisecond timing in bsd.c for polling waits in prep for subsecond @waits. [GM]
* Sqlite3’s [1mREGEXP[0m operator is always available and uses pcre regular expressions (previously it depended on libicu and used java style REs). [SW]
* Update [1mlocal.dst[0m to include example of millisecond callback loop. [MT]
* Updated to use PCRE2 10.33 for regular expressions. [SW]
* Wildcard patterns are sometimes converted to regular expressions when matched against many strings. [SW]
* Add ‘–disable-socket-quota’ option for our test suite. [GM]
* The list of color definitions used with [1mansi()[0m, [1mcolors()[0m, etc. is now kept in game/txt/colors.json. [SW]
* Sqlite3 updated to 3.29. Biggest user-visible change is support for window functions. [SW]
* Update cJSON to 1.7.10 [SW]
* @command/restrict will only clear the failure message if a new one is supplied. [MT]
* @SOCKSET now has a NOQUOTA option which causes that socket to be given the max command input quota per refresh. [MT]
* –disable-socket-quota is now preserved across reboots. [MT]
* Improved detection of an already running game. [SW]
* Support logging through the OS syslog facility. [SW]

Softcode:

* [1maddrlog()[0m for searching through list of unique IP addresses that have connected to a game. [SW]
* [1mconnlog()[0m can return just a count of matching records. [SW]
* [1mformdecode()[0m for decoding HTTP paths and POST bodies. [GM]
* [1m@respond[0m for manipulating HTTP response codes and headers. [GM]
* [1mhmac()[0m for creating authentication fingerprints. [SW]
* [1m@chatformat[0m and channel mogrifiers are told if [1m@cemit/silent[0m is being used. [1267, SW]

Fixes:

* [1madd_function[0m in .cnf files was not properly using the upper case’d string. [#1223, MT]
* Various PCRE calls in the softcode have had CPU time limit watchdogs added. Discovered by Ashen-Shugar. [GM]
* Fix a file descriptor leak caused by recent OpenSSL versions. [SW]
* Added GAGGED restrictions that were missing from a few commands, including [1m@message[0m and the MUXcomm aliases. [MG]
* Minor help updates, including clarification of what GAGGED blocks, suggested by Merit. [#1262, MG, MT]
* Some fixes to extmail.c and chunk.c to fix @mail going forward. [GM]
* switch() and floating point numbers not working as intended. Reported by Mercutio [#1325, MT]
