/* PCRE keeps offsets in its compiled code as 2-byte quantities (always stored
in big-endian order) by default. These are used, for example, to link from the
start of a subpattern to its alternatives and its end. The use of 2 bytes per
offset limits the size of the compiled regex to around 64K, which is big enough
for almost everybody. However, I received a request for an even bigger limit.
For this reason, and also to make the code easier to maintain, the storing and
loading of offsets from the byte string is now handled by the macros that are
defined here.

The macros are controlled by the value of LINK_SIZE. This defaults to 2 in
the config.h file, but can be overridden by using -D on the command line. This
is automated on Unix systems via the "configure" command. */

Each map is 32 bytes long and the bits run from the least
significant end of each byte. The classes that have their own
maps are: space, xdigit, digit, upper, lower, word, graph
print, punct, and cntrl. Other classes are built from combinations. */

all of whose alternatives start with OP_SOD or OP_CIRC (recurse ad lib), then
it's anchored. However, if this is a multiline pattern, then only OP_SOD
counts, since OP_CIRC can match in the middle.

We can also consider a regex to be anchored if OP_SOM starts all its branches.
This is the code for \G, which means "match at start of match position, taking
into account the match offset".

A branch is also implicitly anchored if it starts with .* and DOTALL is set,
because that will try the rest of the pattern at all possible matching points,
so there is no point trying again.... er ....

.... except when the .* appears inside capturing parentheses, and there is a
subsequent back reference to those parentheses. We haven't enough information
to catch that case precisely.

At first, the best we could do was to detect when .* was in capturing brackets
and the highest back reference was greater than or equal to that level.
However, by keeping a bitmap of the first 31 back references, we can catch some
of the more common cases more precisely.

                   RECURSION IN THE match() FUNCTION

The match() function is highly recursive. Some regular expressions can cause
it to recurse thousands of times. I was writing for Unix, so I just let it
call itself recursively. This uses the stack for saving everything that has
to be saved for a recursive call. On Unix, the stack can be large, and this
works fine.

It turns out that on non-Unix systems there are problems with programs that
use a lot of stack. (This despite the fact that every last chip has oodles
of memory these days, and techniques for extending the stack have been known
for decades.) So....

There is a fudge, triggered by defining NO_RECURSE, which avoids recursive
calls by keeping local variables that need to be preserved in blocks of memory
obtained from malloc instead instead of on the stack. Macros are used to
achieve this so that the actual code doesn't look very different to what it
always used to.

/* On entry ecode points to the first opcode, and eptr to the first character
in the subject string, while eptrb holds the value of eptr at the start of the
last bracketed group - used for breaking infinite loops matching zero-length
strings. This function is called recursively in many circumstances. Whenever it
returns a negative (error) response, the outer incarnation must also return the
same response.

Performance note: It might be tempting to extract commonly used fields from the
md structure (e.g. utf8, end_subject) into individual variables to improve
performance. Tests using gcc on a SPARC disproved this; in the first case, it
made performance worse.

Arguments:
   eptr        pointer in subject
   ecode       position in code
   offset_top  current top pointer
   md          pointer to "static" info for the match
   ims         current /i, /m, and /s options
   eptrb       pointer to chain of blocks containing eptr at start of
                 brackets - for testing for empty matches
   flags       can contain
                 match_condassert - this is an assertion condition
                 match_isgroup - this is the start of a bracketed group

Returns:       MATCH_MATCH if matched            )  these values are >= 0
               MATCH_NOMATCH if failed to match  )

         If there are any capturing brackets started but not finished, we have to
         save their starting points and reinstate them after the recursion. However,
         we don't know how many such there are (offset_top records the completed
         total) so we just have to save all the potential data. There may be up to
         65535 such values, which is too large to put on the stack, but using malloc
         for small numbers seems expensive. As a compromise, the stack is used when
         there are no more than REC_STACK_SAVE_MAX values to store; otherwise malloc
         is used. A problem is what to do if the malloc fails ... there is no way of
         returning to the top level with an error. Save the top REC_STACK_SAVE_MAX
         values on the stack, and accept that the rest may be wrong.

         There are also other values that have to be saved. We use a chained
         sequence of blocks that actually live on the stack. Thanks to Robin Houston

/* This function applies a compiled re to a subject string and picks out
portions of the string if it matches. Two elements in the vector are set for
each substring: the offsets to the start and end of the substring.

Arguments:
  argument_re     points to the compiled expression
  extra_data      points to extra data or is NULL
  subject         points to the subject string
  length          length of subject string (may contain binary zeros)
  start_offset    where to start in the subject string
  options         option bits
  offsets         points to a vector of ints to be filled in with offsets
  offsetcount     the number of elements in the vector

Returns:          > 0 => success; value is the number of elements filled in
                  = 0 => success, but offsets is not big enough
                   -1 => failed to match
