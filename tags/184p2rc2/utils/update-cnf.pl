# You make have to change the path to perl above, unless you call this
# script with 'make update'
#
# update-cnf.pl - integrate previous mush.cnf settings with new 
#                  mush.cnf.dist. Results appear in mush.cnf
#
# Usage: update-cnf.pl old-file new-file
#  e.g.: update-cnf.pl game/mush.cnf game/mush.cnf.dist
#
# 'make update' calls this program as in the example above.
#
# Here's how it works.
# First, we make a backup of your old-file to old-file.bak
# If old-file doesn't exist, just copy new-file to it.
# Otherwise... 
# * Read both files, storing all their directives.
# * Then, for each directive in old-file, if one of the same name also
#   exists in new-file, write out old-file's version.
# * If it's a multiple option, like function_alias, add ones present
#   in new-file that aren't in old-file. If old-file has entries that
#   aren't in new-file, also write them out.
# * If it's a single option and is missing from new-file, prompt to
#   keep it or not.
# * Then add directives that are in new-file but not old-file.
