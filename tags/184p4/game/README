             Run-time Installation and Configuration of PennMUSH

This document assumes that you've successfully compiled and installed
PennMUSH as described in the main PennMUSH README file.

The next step is to create your configuration file. In the game
directory is a file called "mush.cnf". If you don't have mush.cnf, but
you have mushcnf.dst, you can copy mushcnf.dst to mush.cnf.  This file
is a list of all runtime configuration options with their default
settting. Change them as you see fit.  IMPORTANT: do not _delete_ any
parameters. If you do, the defaults will still be used. Some options can
be set to empty values to effectively clear them, though.

WIN32 WITH MSVC++:
  Under win32 using the Microsoft compiler, ignore the restart script.
  In the configuration file, turn off disk database compression; it is
  not supported.  Then go to the game directory and run PennMUSH.exe.
  Poof, you're done.

UNIX or WIN32 VIA CYGWIN/MINGW:
  You may need to edit the restart script to change GAMEDIR to the path to 
  the directory containing mush.cnf. Read about the optional settings in 
  that file. The restart script is written for sh, and assumes a fairly 
  standard Berkeley UNIX setup. If you're on a HP-UX or SysV machine, 
  for example, you may need to change the restart script a bit. Then run
  it, with 'sh restart' or './restart'.

You should now be able to log into the game.  This distribution can
generate a minimal database - a God character, starting room, and
master room.  The server will generate this database if it doesn't
find another database to load.

If you're starting with the minimal database, the god character "One"
has no password, so you can log in without one. Of course, you should
immediately set one (via @newpasswd).  mush.cnf has the Master Room
as #2 by default; in the minimal database, this room is created for
you.

Now you should be set -- all you have to do now is customize the .txt
files in the game directory.

The logfiles in the "log" directory generally contain useful
information. You will probably want to read your error logfile
(defined in mush.cnf) every time, since errors and other important
messages get printed to that logfile.

After your first startup, it's a good idea to make some small change
to the database (e.g., @create an object) and then do an
@shutdown. Restart the game again and ensure that your object is still
present - this verifies that the server is successfully dumping.

============================================================================

                            Game Trouble-shooting

If you ever run into trouble, the your first reaction should ALWAYS be
to back up your database. indb.Z.old is the file that the MUSH saves
indb.Z to when the game is restarted, indb.Z is the file that the MUSH
loaded at startup, and outdb.Z is the file to which the MUSH is
currently dumping the database.

You can tell if a dump is (theoretically) complete by doing a
"zcat <database file name> | tail -10".  The last line should read
"***END OF DUMP***". If it doesn't, your database has been truncated
for some reason. Check the logfile. Possible causes include a full
process table, a full disk partition, or running out of disk quota.

Occasionally the dump process may dump core. This is caused by some
sort of corruption in an attribute, normally. You can tell if the dump
process has died by looking in your data directory; you will see
something like "outdb.Z.#5#". Wait a few moments and check on the file
again. If it has grown, then the game is in the process of a normal
dump. If it hasn't, and there's a core file, then something has gone
wrong. You should definitely shout a warning that building is not being
saved.

To attempt to fix the problem, do a @dbck to take care of any possible
minor weirdness in the database, then try doing a "@dump/paranoid",
and reading the checkpoint logfile (default is log/checkpt.log). This
is slow, but it will write out an uncorrupted database, and tell you
what it fixed. Back up that database and indb.Z, then figure out what
you're going to do next: you can take the game down with a kill -9, or
attempt to manually fix the problem by either @destroying the
offending object, or attempting to reset the attributes on the object
that are causing a problem.  If "@dump/paranoid" dies, you are more or
less out of luck.

The game may crash from time to time. It will generate a core file,
usually; if you don't limit the coredumpsize or strip the executable,
you should be able to get some useful information out of it, using a
debugger. The developers are interested in stack traces. You can do a
stack trace in the following manner: Go into the directory where you
keep your source code, and type
	<name of debugger> netmud ../game/core
If you don't call your executable "netmud", substitute in whatever you
do call it.

You are looking for variables set to bizarre values - attempts to
access objects that aren't there, attempts to use pointers which point
to nothing, and the like.

If you are using the "adb" debugger (don't do this unless you really
have absolutely nothing else available), you will see nothing. It's
loaded and ready, though. Type "$c". This will print out a list of the
functions it called. Type "$q" to quit. You can't really get much more
useful information out of adb.

If you are using the "dbx" debugger, type "where" to see the stack
trace. You can move through it using "up" and "down", and see exactly
what the sequence of calls was. You can also use "print <variable
name>" to see the value of a variable at the time the game crashed.
The "gdb" debugger is similar to "dbx"; with that, you can abbreviate
"print" as "p". It is the reccomended debugger to use; when gdb is
present on your system and you're using gcc as the compiler, gcc is
told to use a gdb-specific debugging format.

If you want to start PennMUSH running under a debugger, instead of
attaching to an already-running process, it'll need two arguments:
--no-session, and the name of your config file if it is different than
mush.cnf. Without --no-session, the server will immediately fork off a
detatched child process, and the debugger will tell you that the
process exited normally..

The PennMUSH developers appreciate news of any bugs found, and any
patches that have been written to deal with them. We are also
interested in any extensions that people make to the code, and
requests that ones that are of more than just local interest be sent
to us for inclusion in the next release of this code. See
http://code.google.com/p/pennmush/.

One important thing to remember is, if the MUSH refuses to start,
there is probably a good reason. Check the MUSH log, and the core
file, if there is one. Make sure to back up your database before
attempting to restart -- remember that every time it restarts, it
overwrites indb.Z.old. If you restart three times and somehow manage
to trash your database each time (for example, a full process table
zero'ing out your files), you won't have a backup to restart from,
unless you've backed up your database before trying!
