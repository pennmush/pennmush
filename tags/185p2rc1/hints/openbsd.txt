Penn will compile and run out of the box on OpenBSD, with the caveats
below:

* OpenBSD (4.2, probably other releases as well) will not forward IPv4
  connection to a listening IPv6 port by default, and the sysctl
  invocation that should change this fails with an 'Operation not
  supported' error. Pass --disable-ipv6 to configure.
