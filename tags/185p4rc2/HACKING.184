Version 1.8.4 patchlevel 8                                 Nov 11, 2011

  command_check_byname() and command_check_byname_quiet() now both take
  an additional NEW_PE_INFO *pe_info arg, used for evaluating the
  command boolexp lock. command_check() is now an #define'd wrapper for
  a new command_check_with() function, which also takes a pe_info. [MG]
  
Version 1.8.4 patchlevel 7                                 Sep 25, 2011

  The bitsets that store set flags and powers on objects are now
  shared. All objects with the same flags or powers set share the same
  bitset (Called a flagset in documentation). As a result, nobody
  should be setting or clearing bits in those fields directly. Use the
  API in flags.h instead, with things like set_flag_internal().

  Function defintions -- FUNCTION(fun_foo) {...} -- now receive an extra
  argument, eflags. Useful for functions which do further evaluation
  of their arguments after being called (particularly NOPARSE functions),
  the variable contains the appropriate PE_* flags to be used when calling
  process_expression. For example, the S() function previously used:
  
    process_expression(buff, bp, &p, executor, caller, enactor, PE_DEFAULT,
                       PT_DEFAULT, pe_info);
                       
  and now uses
  
    process_expression(buff, bp, &p, executor, caller, enactor, eflags,
                       PT_DEFAULT, pe_info);
  
  Ensures that PE_USERFN and PE_[NO]DEBUG are properly passed down. When
  evaluating another attribute, you should continue to use PE_UDEFAULT
  instead of eflags (or use a function like call_ufun to evaluate it).



Version 1.8.4 patchlevel 5                                 Jun 19,  2011
  ansi_string has been heavily rewritten. as->text and as->len still
  work for accessing, everything else about ansi_string has been heavily
  modified.

  ptab_firstentry_new and ptab_nextentry_new now take a pointer to a 
  char * to store a read-only copy of the current entry's key in, instead
  of a user-supplied buffer that may or may not be big enough.

  notify.c has been rewritten, and notify_anything()'s args have changed.
  To get the same behaviour, change:
    notify_anything(speaker, func, data, nospoof_func, flags, message);
  to
    notify_anything(speaker, func, data, NULL, flags, message, NULL, 
                    AMBIGUOUS, NULL);
  If nospoof_func is NULL, make sure you include NA_SPOOF in the new flags.
  Many other functions in notify.c have also changed - check the comments
  on the functions for more info on the new arguments.

Version 1.8.4 patchlevel 4                                 May 05,  2011

  PE_REGS now contains switch, @switch, iter, @dol and env (%0-%9).
  The old way of passing arguments will no longer work. Instead, read
  the HACKING.PE_REGS file for information on PE_REGS. This is paving
  the way for a more flexible arg/environment structure: Possible more
  than 10 %-args (Named %-args? Who knows?)

  Regexps are now stored in the PE_REGS structure. re_context is gone
  from NEW_PE_INFO. Instead, use pe_regs_*.

  Q-registers are now stored in a PE_REGS structure, which will eventually
  also consume all other forms of registers. To set a Q register, use
  the macro PE_Setq(pe_info, name, val). To fetch a Q register, use
  the macro PE_Getq(pe_info, name, val). To check if a (char *) is a
  valid register name, use ValidQregName((char *)).

  With the PE_REGS change, all Q-registers now have both their names and
  their values kept in a string tree, reducing overhead caused by
  duplicates. This also means that you should _NOT_ modify any values
  returned by PE_Getq().

  With PE_REGS containing q-registers across queue entries, the memory used
  by a single entry in a player, object, @wait or semaphore queue is reduced
  by about BUFFER_LEN*NUMQ bytes, assuming no Q-registers used. By default,
  this amounts to 294KB!

  wild_match_case_r, regexp_match_case_r and local_wild_match all accept
  a new parameter after the last: a PE_REGS. For old behavior, simply add
  a NULL parameter at the end.

  global_eval_context has been removed, as have the BQUE and PE_Info
  sutrcts. All the information they contained has been merged into two new
  structs, MQUE and NEW_PE_INFO. The environment (%0-%9) and q-regs (%q*)
  are now part of NEW_PE_INFO. Commands are passed the MQUE (queue entry)
  they're being evaluated as part of as 'queue_entry', and can access
  queue_entry->pe_info if they need to evaluate anything/change environment
  variables, etc.
  
  In COMMAND() definitions, the variable 'player' (object running the
  command) has been renamed 'executor' and 'cause' (object which caused the
  command to be run) has been renamed 'enactor', for clarity and consistancy
  with softcode. You will need to update your commands in cmdlocal.c

Version 1.8.4 patchlevel 3                                 Mar 18,  2011

 queue_event(<enactor or SYSEVENT>, <attribute name>, "argfmt", ...)
     lets you queue events on the event handler, if set.

 Using a bunch of gencomp() calls, such as for setunion, is now deprecated,
     you should use get_list_type_info, slist_build, slist_qsort, slist_free
     and free_list_type_info. Look at fun_setmanip and do_gensort for how
     to do it.

 list2arr_ansi() now calls list2arr() when there is no markup.

 list2arr_ansi and list2arr now take a third argument, 'nullok'. If nullok
     is 0, then it will ignore null items. For old behaviour, pass 1.

 All timed events have been moved to a new system queue:
     timed callbacks are of the type "bool (*sq_func)(void *data);".
     To set up a callback, use:
       sq_register_in(<wait time>, <sq_func>, <data>, <event name>)
     To repeat it infinitely:
       sq_register_loop(<wait time>, <sq_func>, <data>, <event name>)
     sq_func() is called with <data> as its argument.
     If <event name> is non-NULL and sq_func returns a boolean true, then
     the queue will trigger the event <event name> with no arguments when it
     is completed calling sq_func.
 
 Because of the change to system queue for timed events, local_timer in local.c
     has been changed. If you haven't changed local.c, just copy local.dst over
     it. If you have, and you want local_timer to run every second, then
     add sq_register_loop(1, local_timer, NULL, NULL); to local_startup(),
     and change local_timer's signature to:
         bool local_timer(void *data __attribute__((__unused__)))
     and return false.


 In the DESC struct, descriptors which have not connected to a player now have
 d->player set to NOTHING (-1) instead of 0.
