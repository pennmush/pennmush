Version 1.8.5 patchlevel 6                                 ??? ??, 2014

Monikers:
 * ansi_name() now takes an additional arg, maxlen, to possibly trim (but not
   pad) the name to be at most maxlen characters long. You probably don't want
   to call ansi_name() directly, though; generally you'll want to use the 
   AName() or AaName() wrappers. If you need to make use of maxlen, use the
   new AnsiNameWrapper() macro instead:
     AnsiNameWrapper(dbref, accents?, AN_* flag, pointer, maxlen)
   AName and AaName are now wrappers around this wrapper. Hardcode Inception.

Version 1.8.5 patchlevel 5                                 Nov 20, 2013

Monikers:
 * Many calls of Name() and accented_name() have been replaced with AName() 
   and AaName(), respectively. Syntax is:
     AName(dbref, AN_FLAG, pointer);
   where dbref is the object whose name should be returned, AN_FLAG is one
   of the AN_* flags defined in dbdefs.h, specifying what kind of the message
   the name is used in, and pointer is an optional bool pointer, set to 1 if
   the name returned is monikered. (Note: it is NOT always set to 0 when the 
   name is not monikered. Initialize yourself before calling.)
 * call_ufun() has been renamed call_ufun_int(), and has an extra arg,
   void* data. Only used with UFUN_NAME. call_ufun() is an #define to
   call_ufun_int(), passing data as NULL, for backwards compatability.
 * The *did_it*() functions now take an extra arg
 * spname() has been renamed spname_int(), and has an extra bool arg to 
   determine whether ansi and accents should be included. spname() is now an
   #define to spname_int, with ansi/accents on.

Wildcards:
 * wild_match_case_r(), regexp_match_case_r(), pe_regs_set_rx_context()
   and pe_regs_set_rx_context_ansi() now take an extra argument, a PE_REGS*
   flag to determine how matching subpatterns are stored in pe_regs. This
   allows the functions to be used directly from atr_comm_match (which 
   matches for $-commands). The extra arg is immediately after the 
   PE_REGS *pe_regs arg - for [wild|regexp]_match_case_r(), it's the final
   arg, for pe_regs_set_rx_context[_ansi]() it's the second arg. In all
   existing cases, pass it as PE_REGS_REGEXP for the old behaviour.
   
Pe_Regs:
 * pi_regs_get_env()'s second arg is now char*, instead of int, to allow for
   named arguments. Only use the function directly for named arguments - for
   integer args (%0-%9) use the PE_Get_Env(pe_regs, int) macro
   
Other:
 * add_flag_generic() now returns an enum, flag_res, so it can give more
   specific failure information. The flag created (if any) is now stored
   in a user-specific pointer, which is passed as the final arg to the
   function. add_flag() and add_power() pass NULL for this arg so, if you
   need to know which flag was created, call add_flag_generic() directly.

Version 1.8.5 patchlevel 4                                 Nov 09, 2012

  do_teleport() now takes a bitwise or of TEL_* flags (defined in externs.h)
  instead of separate 'silent' and 'inside' args. [MG]
