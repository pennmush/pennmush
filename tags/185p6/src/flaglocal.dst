/*-----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Local flags
 *
 * This file is reserved for local flags that you may wish
 * to hack into PennMUSH.
 * This file will not be overwritten when you update
 * to a new distribution, so it's preferable to add new flags
 * here and leave flag.c alone.
 *
 * YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SEEING THAT YOU DO THIS RIGHT - 
 * It's probably smarter to have God @flag/add rather than
 * do it here, as @flag/add does extensive checks for safety,
 * and add_flag() doesn't! Remember that flags are saved in the
 * database, so flags added here won't overwrite flags that
 * are already defined. When in doubt, use @flag.
 *
 * It is explicitly safe to try to add_flag() an existing flag.
 * It won't do anything, but it won't be harmful.
