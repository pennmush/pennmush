The files in this directory contains additional information about
configuring PennMUSH on various operating systems. If there isn't
one for your OS, and you need to pass special options and/or set
the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables to add directories
to the search patch for libraries (Or if you had to do something
beyond what's in the provided hint file), please file a report at
http://dev.pennmush.org telling us  what you had to do so the hints
can be added to the next release.

For Windows hints and directions see the win32 directory. There are
instructions there for Microsoft compilers, cygwin, and mingw.

The OS.txt files are the current ones. OS.sh files are hints from the
old configure system that we haven't updated yet. Please file a bug
report at the URL above if you have access to one of those systems and
are willing to help update hints for it.
