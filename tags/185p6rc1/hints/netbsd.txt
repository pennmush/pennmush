Penn will compile and run out of the box on NetBSD, including OpenSSL

* Mysql and Postgres should be detected if their packages have been
  installed through pkgsrc or pkg_add and /usr/pkg/bin is in your

  you need to tell configure to look in the /usr/pkg hierarchy for it:

  % CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/pkg/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/pkg/lib ./configure
