Penn has been briefly tested on Minix 3.3.0. It builds and you can log
in, but further testing or porting has not been done at this point, and likely
won't unless some poor fool like Raevnos is really really really bored.

From a base install, you need to install the following packages (Via
pkgin): binutils, clang, perl, pcre

Call configure like so:

% CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/pkg/lib" ./configure --disable-nls --disable-info_slave --disable-ssl_slave
