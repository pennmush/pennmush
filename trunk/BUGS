Bugs that aren't our fault, but might bite people:

Modern: 

* You might experience crashes because the default executable stack
  size is too small. An 8 megabyte stack is more than ample. On unix,
  it can be raised with 'ulimit -s 8192'. On Windows, you must use the
  editbin progam that comes with MS development environments to raise
  the stack on a per-executable basis, via 'editbin /STACK:8388608
  netmush.exe'

* Some IPv6-enabled systems are not configured out of the box to
  tunnel IPv4 connection attempts on the same port to the IPv6 socket
  that is listening. If you can connect to a local game via ::1 but
  not 127.0.0.1 this is likely the issue. On unix systems, a user with
  root privileges can do 'sysctl -w net.inet6.ip6.v6only=0', after
  which you'll have to do a complete shutdown and restart of the mush
  for the change to take effect. The file /etc/sysctl.conf will have
  to be changed too so the change persists across server reboots.
  If that's not practical, you can get an IPv4-only mush by doing
  the following:
  
   % ./configure --disable-ipv6
   % make
   
  Then do a full @shutdown of the game and run restart.
