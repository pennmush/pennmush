Version 1.8.4 patchlevel 3                                 ??? ??,  201?

 queue_event(<enactor or SYSEVENT>, <attribute name>, "argfmt", ...)
     lets you queue events on the event handler, if set.

 Using a bunch of gencomp() calls, such as for setunion, is now deprecated,
     you should use get_list_type_info, slist_build, slist_qsort, slist_free
     and free_list_type_info. Look at fun_setmanip and do_gensort for how
     to do it.

 list2arr_ansi() now calls list2arr() when there is no markup.

 list2arr_ansi and list2arr now take a third argument, 'nullok'. If nullok
     is 0, then it will ignore null items. For old behaviour, pass 1.

 All timed events have been moved to a new system queue:
     timed callbacks are of the type "bool (*sq_func)(void *data);".
     To set up a callback, use:
       sq_register_in(<wait time>, <sq_func>, <data>, <event name>)
     To repeat it infinitely:
       sq_register_loop(<wait time>, <sq_func>, <data>, <event name>)
     sq_func() is called with <data> as its argument.
     If <event name> is non-NULL and sq_func returns a boolean true, then
     the queue will trigger the event <event name> with no arguments when it
     is completed calling sq_func.
 
 Because of the change to system queue for timed events, local_timer in local.c
     has been changed. If you haven't changed local.c, just copy local.dst over
     it. If you have, and you want local_timer to run every second, then
     add sq_register_loop(1, local_timer, NULL, NULL); to local_startup(),
     and change local_timer's signature to:
         bool local_timer(void *data __attribute__((__unused__)))
     and return false.


 In the DESC struct, descriptors which have not connected to a player now have
 d->player set to NOTHING (-1) instead of 0.
