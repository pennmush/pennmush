Version 1.8.5 patchlevel 5                                 ??? ??, 2013

Monikers:
 * Many calls of Name() and accented_name() have been replaced with AName() 
   and AaName(), respectively. Syntax is:
     AName(dbref, AN_FLAG, pointer);
   where dbref is the object whose name should be returned, AN_FLAG is one
   of the AN_* flags defined in dbdefs.h, specifying what kind of the message
   the name is used in, and pointer is an optional bool pointer, set to 1 if
   the name returned is monikered. (Note: it is NOT always set to 0 when the 
   name is not monikered. Initialize yourself before calling.)
 * call_ufun() has been renamed call_ufun_int(), and has an extra arg,
   void* data. Only used with UFUN_NAME. call_ufun() is an #define to
   call_ufun_int(), passing data as NULL, for backwards compatability.
 * The *did_it*() functions now take an extra arg
 * spname() has been renamed spname_int(), and has an extra bool arg to 
   determine whether ansi and accents should be included. spname() is now an
   #define to spname_int, with ansi/accents on.

Version 1.8.5 patchlevel 4                                 Nov 09, 2012

  do_teleport() now takes a bitwise or of TEL_* flags (defined in externs.h)
  instead of separate 'silent' and 'inside' args. [MG]
