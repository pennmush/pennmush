# Command aliases that you'd like reserved.
# Normally, commands are autoaliased to their unique prefixes,
# so n -> news
# However, you might prefer to have n not treated as a command alias
# because you think of it as short for 'north' and want to use a 
# master room exit to catch it. In that case, you'd uncomment
# lines like this:
#reserve_alias e
#reserve_alias w
#reserve_alias s
#reserve_alias n
#reserve_alias nw
#reserve_alias ne
#reserve_alias sw
#reserve_alias se
#reserve_alias u
#reserve_alias d

# We add a dummy here to make updating easier
reserve_alias dummy_exit_alias

# You can also alias commands to other names.
# command_alias EXISTING_COMMAND ALIAS
# For example, a french-language game do the following:
# command_alias think pensent
# Some standard aliases:
command_alias @edit @gedit
# Alias read to look?
#command_alias look read 

command_alias look l
command_alias inventory i
command_alias @switch @sw
command_alias page p
command_alias whisper w
command_alias goto move
command_alias @atrlock @attrlock
command_alias @atrchown @attrchown
command_alias get take

# As well as commands, functions can be aliased. Same syntax,
# just function_alias instead of command_alias. Note that many
# functions use the same internal function, doing slightly different
# things depending on the name it was called by. The hasattr*() functions
# are an example of these. Aliases of this type of function may not work
# right.
# Some standard aliases:
function_alias lsearch search
function_alias soundslike soundlike
function_alias lstats stats
function_alias trunc val
function_alias nattr attrcnt
function_alias nattrp attrpcnt
function_alias iter parse
function_alias modulo mod
function_alias modulo modulus
function_alias randword pickrand
function_alias lthings lobjects
function_alias lvthings lvobjects
function_alias nthings nobjects
function_alias nvthings nvobjects
function_alias xthings xobjects
function_alias xvthings xvobjects
function_alias atrlock attrlock
function_alias hostname host
function_alias idlesecs idle

# For rhost compatibility
function_alias textfile dynhelp

# And so can attributes!
attribute_alias describe desc
attribute_alias idescribe idesc
attribute_alias success succ
attribute_alias osuccess osucc
attribute_alias asuccess asucc
attribute_alias failure fail
attribute_alias ofailure ofail
attribute_alias afailure afail
