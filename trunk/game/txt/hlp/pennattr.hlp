& ATTRIBUTE FLAGS
  Attribute flags are set on an object's attributes using @set, or applied
  to attributes globally using @attribute. Their names (and, when applicable,
  the character used in examine as shorthand for the flag) are shown below.
  
  These attribute flags restrict access, and are inherited down attribute
  trees (if FOO is no_command, FOO`BAR is automatically no_command too):

  no_command ($)    Attribute won't be checked for $-commands or 
                    ^-listen patterns.
  no_inherit (i)    Attribute will not be inherited by the children of
                    this object.
  no_clone (c)      Attribute will not be copied if the object is @clone'd.
  mortal_dark (m)   Attribute cannot be seen by mortals. This flag can only
                    be set by royalty and wizards. "hidden" is a synonym.
  wizard (w)        Attribute can only be set by wizards.
                    This flag can only be set by royalty and wizards.
  veiled (V)        Attribute value won't be shown on default examine, but 
                    is still otherwise accessible (for spammy attribs).
  nearby (n)        Even if the attribute is visual, it can only be retrieved
                    if you're near the object (see 'help nearby()').
  locked (+)        Attribute is locked with @atrlock.
  safe (S)          Attribute can't be modified without unsetting this flag.

  These attribute flags grant access. They are not inherited down attribute
  trees, and must be set a branch attribute as well as a leaf to take effect
  (to make FOO`BAR visual, FOO must be visual too):
  
  visual (v)        Attribute can be seen by anyone via get(), eval(),
                    ufun(), zfun(), and similar functions.
  public (p)        This attribute can be evaluated by any object, even
                    if safer_ufun is in use. DANGEROUS! AVOID!

  These attribute flags alter the way attributes are used in commands and
  ^-listens. They always only affect the attribute they're set on, regardless
  of attribute trees:

  debug (b)         Start showing debug output while this attr is evaluated.
  no_debug (B)      Stop showing debug output when this attr is evaluated
  regexp (R)        Match $-commands and ^-listens using regular expressions.
                    See 'help regexps'.
  case (C)          Match $-commands and ^-listens case sensitively.
  nospace (s)       Attribute won't add a space after the object name in 
                    @o-* messages. See 'help verbs'.
  noname (N)        Attribute won't show name in @o-* messages.

  aahear (A)        ^-listens on this attribute match like @aahear
  amhear (M)        ^-listens on this attribute match like @amhear
  prefixmatch       When set with @<attrib>, this attribute will be matched
                    down to its unique prefixes. This flag is primarily used
                    internally, but also useful in @attribute/access.
                    
  These attribute flags are only used internally, and shown on 'examine':
  `                 This attribute is a branch. See: help ATTRIBUTE TREES

Attributes can be arranged in a hierarchical tree; these are called
"attribute trees", and a conceptually similar to the way that
files and directories/folders are organized on computer filesystems.
Attribute trees can be used to reduce spam when examining and to
provide organized control over permissions for related attributes.

Attribute trees use the backtick (`) character to separate their
components (much as filesystems use / or \). For example, the
following attribute name would be a couple levels down in its tree:

  CHAR`SKILLS`PHYSICAL

Attribute names may not start or end with the backtick, and may not
contain two backticks in a row.

All attributes are either branch attributes or leaf attributes.
A branch attribute is an attribute that has other branches or leaves
beneath it; a leaf attribute is one that does not. Any attribute may
act as a branch. If you try to create an unsupported leaf, branch
attributes will be created as needed to support it.

See 'help attribute trees2' for more information and examples.

Attribute trees provide two immediate benefits. First, they reduce
spam when examining objects. The usual * and ? wildcards for attributes
do not match the ` character; the new ** wildcard does. Some
examples of using examine:
   examine obj              displays top-level attributes (plus object header)
   examine obj/*            displays top-level attributes
   examine obj/BRANCH`      displays only attributes immediately under BRANCH
   examine obj/BRANCH`*     displays only attributes immediately under BRANCH
   examine obj/BRANCH`**    displays entire tree under BRANCH
   examine obj/**           displays all attributes of object

The same principles apply to lattr(). @decompile obj is a special case,
and displays all attributes.

Branch attributes will be displayed with a ` in the attribute flags
on examine. 

See 'help attribute trees3' for more information and examples.

The second benefit of attributes trees is convenient access control.
Attribute flags that restrict attribute access or execution
(no_inherit, no_command, mortal_dark, wizard) propagate down
attribute trees, so if a branch is set mortal_dark, mortals can
not read any of its leaves or subbranches either.

Attribute flags that grant access (e.g. visual) do NOT propagate down
trees.

These properties make attribute trees ideal for data attributes:
  &DATA bank = Data for each depositor is stored here, by dbref
  @set bank/DATA = no_command
  &DATA`#30 bank = $2000 savings:$1000 loan @ 5%
  ...

They're also handy for things like character attributes:
  @attribute/access CHAR = wizard mortal_dark no_clone no_inherit
  &CHAR #30 = Character data
  &CHAR`SKILLS #30 = coding:3 documentation:1 obfuscation:5
  ...

See 'help attribute trees4' for information about @parent and attribute trees.

Attribute trees interact with @parent in several ways.

As usual, children inherit attributes from their parent unless the
child has its own overriding attribute. However, children that wish
to override a leaf attribute must also have their own (overriding)
copy of all branches leading to that leaf. This means that when you do:

  &BRANCH parent = a branch
  &BRANCH`LEAF parent = a leaf
  &BRANCH`LEAF child = a new leaf

In this case, a new BRANCH attribute will be created on the child,
so '-[get(child/BRANCH)]-' will return '--'. This may not be what
you actually want.

If a branch on the parent is set no_inherit, it will not be inherited,
regardless of any other flags that may be present. If a branch is
inherited, the child object can not loosen any access restrictions to
inherited attributes that are set by the parent (although it may loosen
access restrictions to its own attributes on the same branch). The child
object may impose stricter restrictions, however, and these may prevent
access to inherited parent data.
