& download
The latest version of this MUSH code is available from
http://code.google.com/p/pennmush/downloads/list. It will be called
something like pennmush-1.8.3p9.tar.bz2, depending on the version number.

Also on that site is the MUSH manual, in /Manuals. It should be called
mushman.2.008.tar.Z or something similar; you should attempt to get at
least version 2.007.  Also on that site is Javelin's Guide for
PennMUSH Gods, in /pub/PennMUSH/Guide. A better way to read it is on
the Web at http://javelin.pennmush.org/~alansz/guide.html

& internationalization
& locale
& translation
Internationalization support in PennMUSH includes:
* Support for (8-bit) locale-based character sets, including
  translation of iso-8859-1 accented characters to html entities for
  Pueblo, the accent() and stripaccents() functions, and the NOACCENTS
  flag.
* Support for locale-based date/time formats
* Support for locale-based message sets for translations of server
  messages. There are active translation teams (and you can join!)
  and several languages have practically complete translation files
  available from the PennMUSH ftp site.
* Some support for locale-based string collation
* The ability to alias command and function names, so you can generate
  a set of translated commands/functions.

Most of these features get enabled by setting an appropriate environment
variable in the PennMUSH restart script.

Unicode is not currently supported.

are granted permission to copy and modify PennMUSH:

The Artistic License

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through
textual modification.
"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright
Holder.
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights
for the package.
"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will
not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the
computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions
they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of
the following:

 a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
 Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
 equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
 such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
 modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

 b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

 c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
 standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
 manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how
 it differs from the Standard Version.

 d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

 a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
 together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
 to get the Standard Version.

 b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
 Package with your modifications.

 c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
 Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
 non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual
 pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the
 Standard Version.

 d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you
may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)
programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under
the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them,
and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
shall not be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this software without specific prior
written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
