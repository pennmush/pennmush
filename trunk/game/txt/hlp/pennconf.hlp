& @config parameters
 Many of the mush's run-time options can be set from the game by
 wizards, using @config/set <option>=<new value>. Those that can be set
 with visible changes are listed below, grouped by category. See help
 @config <category> for details on each.

  Attribs      Chat       Cmds        Cosmetic      Costs
  Db           Dump       Flags       Funcs         Limits
  Log          Net        Tiny

 The categories and groups are the same as those used by @config/list.
 Values must be of the listed type for each option. They include:
 <number>, <dbref>, <boolean> (Yes/No), <time>, or <string>.

 Options which take a <time> will accept either a number of seconds
 or a combination of numbers followed by 's' for seconds, 'm' for
 minutes or 'h' for hours, making 1h30m and 5400 equivalent.

 <dbref> options can be given with or without the leading '#', so
 '1' and '#1' are the same.
