Version 1.8.3 patchlevel 10                     Apr ??, 2009

Minor changes:
 * @search and lsearch() now only charge 100 pennies if an evaluating
   search (EVAL, EPLAYER, EROOM, ETHING, EOBJECT, EEXIT or ELOCK) or
   an exhaustive attribute search (COMMAND, LISTEN) is performed.

Fixes:
  * @pcreate without a password would crash the game. Fixed. [GM]
  * DARK-disconnected on channels was turned into DARK-connected, on
    disconnect. Reported by Paige@M*U*S*H, among others.
  * MOGRIFY`BLOCK wasn't being called, as help @channel6 said it was.
    Oops. [GM]
  * Some help fixes. [GM]
  * @clone could mess up the names of the original and the clone. 
    Reported by qa'toq. [SW]
  * Crash bugs in rand() and randword(). [SW]
  * Added --disable-zlib configure option to turn off using
    zlib to work directly with compressed databases. Passing this to
    configure makes the game act like pre p8 ones. [SW]

& 1.8.3p9
Version 1.8.3 patchlevel 9                      Feb 28, 2009

Fixes:
 * Starting up without an existing database was broken in p8.
   Reported by many people. [SW]
 * p8 didn't compile for many people for a number of reasons.
   [SW]
 * match() was broken. Reported by Kimiko. [SW]

& 1.8.3p8
Version 1.8.3 patchlevel 8                      Feb 26, 2009

Major changes:
 * @chan/mogrifier - Mogrify (mangle) any and all aspects of @channel
   chatter. e.g: make <Public> into [cilbuP]. [GM]

Minor changes:
 * The restart script appends a timestamp to the backups of
   existing databases and log files that it makes. Suggested
   by Ray,
 * @setting a flag that's already set will say so. Suggested by
   Kimiko, patch by Talvo.
 * Added 'magic sort': Sorts strings with embedded numbers and
   dbrefs.
 * Controlling whether info_slave is used or not moved into configure
   from options.h. (--enable-info_slave/--disable-info_slave). [SW]
 * Experimental change to attribute lookup to reduce the number of
   expensive string comparisions needed. [SW]
 * Updated the Mersenne Twister PRNG to a newer version (Look up
   SFMT for details). [SW]
 * New configure options --enable-sse2, --enable-sse2 and
   --enable-altivec. Currently only used in a few spots, including
   the new version of the PRNG. [SW]
 * Remove the MALLOC_PACKAGE option and csrimalloc, the only remaining
   non-system malloc() choice for it. csrimalloc didn't compile any more
   and there are better memory debugging tools available these days (The
   rational for keeping it when other malloc packages were removed.) [SW]
 * The mush can now read and write gzip-compressed databases without 
   relying on external programs if the server has zlib installed. [SW]
 * @search and search() now have a 'command' and 'listen' search class,
   allowing @searches for objects that respond to given $-commands and
   listen patterns. [GM]
 * New config option to reserve space on startup for the chunk swap
   file to reduce on-disc fragmentation (With a supported OS). [SW]
 * @shutdown/reboot makes an effort to verify that the executable
   still exists before trying to restart. Suggested by Alrynnic. [SW]

Commands:
 * @config/save foo=bar acts like @config/set but also attempts to
   alter the original configuration file to reflect the new value. [SW]
 * Wizards can specify a garbage dbref for @create and @pcreate to
   re-use instead of the first free one. Suggested by Mercutio, based
   on patch by Talvo.

Functions:
 * Improved the soundex() implementation. [SW]
 * Removed the arbitrary limit on the number of @functions. [SW]

Fixes:
 * locate() always used english matching even when not explicitly told
   to. Patch by Talvo.
 * sha0 hashing was broken on 64 bit systems without OpenSSL. Reported
   by Exaurdon. [SW]
 * The dump_complete message wasn't being shown on a successful forking
   dump. Reported by cquesnel. [SW]
 * speak() deals better with message strings like 'you," he adds, "rock!"'
   Reported by Summer, fix based on Javelin's analysis.
 * speak() deals better with mismatched quotes. Reported by Summer. [SW]
 * A long-standing bug where it was possible for multiple mushes to use
   the same port (One on an IPv6 version, one on a IPv4 one) is now
   harder to trigger and gives a better error message. [SW]
 * Plug a memory leak in decode64().
 * wild matching with ansi involved has been fixed. [GM]
 * clflags() sometimes truncated its result. Reported by dbwiddis. [SW]

& 1.8.3p7
Version 1.8.3 patchlevel 7                      Oct 01, 2008

Minor changes:
 * If compiling with a recent enough version of gcc to support the
   -fstack-protector option to detect buffer overruns, use it.
 * Compile with -mdynamic-no-pic on powerpc OS X, resulting in a smaller
   binary.
 * On newer Linux systems, detect when various indexed and cached files
   are changed and automatically reload them instead of waiting for a 
   @readcache.
 * New map data structure with integer keys, used in various places.
 * Queue entries now have process ids, used to identify and act on that
   particular action list. This and associated commands inspired
   by [Rhost].
 * New configure option --disable-sql to turn off checks for all supported
   SQL servers.
 * @name strips out quotes around player names even if spaces in them are
   disabled.
 * The test suite can now use valgrind to identify buffer overflows and
   similiar problems triggered by tests, by passing the --valgrind option
   to test scripts.
 * Significantly reduce memory usage in @sitelock rules. 

Commands:
 * '@hook/override cmd=#1234' will look at all attributes on the object
   for a matching $command. By Talvo.
 * @sitelock/delete NNN will remove the sitelock rule with that number.
 * @halt/pid NNN will remove a specific queue entry. Get the pid from 
   @ps. [Rhost]
 * @wait/pid will adjust the wait time of queue entries. [Rhost]
 * @chan/title <channel> will display your current channel title. 
   @chan/title <channel>= will clear it. Patch by Talvo, suggested by
   Ender.
  * @chan/recall could be used on any channel, not just by people on
   a given channel. Patch by Talvo.

Functions:
 * controls(<who>,<what>/<attribute>) tests if someone can change or
   create a specific attribute on an object. By Talvo.
 * hasattr() and family also understand foo(<object>/<attribute>) in
   addition to the traditional two-argument form. Suggested by Impster,
   patch by Talvo.
 * cbufferadd() - Add text to a channel buffer without broadcasting it.
   Allows for @chan/recall on an @chat that's been overridden.
 * Rewrote the internals of round() to avoid some nasty kludges. [SW]
 * ljust() and rjust() take fill strings now, not just single
   characters. Suggested by Nyssa, patch by Talvo.
 * baseconv() now supports up to base64.
 * The undocumented (And unusable) orpowers() and andpowers() functions
   were removed.
 * andlpowers() and orlpowers() were missing help files. Reported by
   Parusso.

Fixes:
 * Potential infinite loop in error logging fixed. Reported by Yuriko.
 * Compilation fixes on various platforms. [SW]
 * A repeatingly crashing info_slave won't block login attempts.
 * @chan/what reports the number of actual lines stored in 
   recall buffers, not the number of blocks. Reported by
   qa'toq [SW]
 * portmsg didn't compile. Reported by Impster. [SW]
 * A chat db with a garbage object on a channel would fail to load.
   Reported by Eratl. 
 * Fixed a double free error in page. By Ricochet.
 * Many help file and source documentation fixes reported by far too
   many people to list.
 * Hard-to-trigger double free() in help file reindexing fixed.

& 1.8.3p6
Version 1.8.3 patchlevel 6                      Jan 01, 2008

Major changes:
 * If configure finds a copy of the pcre library installed, that will
   be used instead of the (old) version bundled with Penn. use
   --with-pcre=/path/to/it if it's not in the usual places, or
   --with-pcre=no to force use of the bundled version.

Minor changes:
 * @sitelock when there are no rules will now say that instead of
   having no output. By Talvo.
 * Log files use locking to prevent the small chance of more than one
   process writing to the same error log at the same time.
 * info_slave's logging is more clear as to its source.
 * Several places that used the select() system call now favor poll()
   and/or socket timeouts instead. (The main event loop still uses
   select() for now.)
 * A wildcard help topic search (help foo*) that only matches one
   entry will display that entry. Suggested by Cheetah.
 * New switches for commands no longer have to be added to the
   SWITCHES file; the internal list of switches is now built based on
   what switches are given in the command table and cmdlocal.c
   additions. Suggested by Talek. 


Flags and powers:
 * The announce power now also grants the ability to change the motd.
   Suggested by Yuriko.
 * New hook power grants rights to use @hook. Suggested by Paige.
 * Windows compile fixes by Intrevis.

Commands:
 * @motd gives better feedback when clearing a message.
 * The @tport/@otport/@atport/etc. attributes that get evalulated on a
   @teleport now get the dbref of the object doing the teleport in %0
   and the teleported object's old location in %1. Suggested by Daniel
   Cheng.

Functions:
 * root() uses an improved algorithm to give a more precise
   result.
 * log(N,2) uses the C log2() function if available.
 * log(N,e) takes the natural logarithm of N, like ln().
 * lports() now takes an optional viewer argument, a la lwho(). By
   Talvo.

Fixes:
 * Typo in info_slave preventing simultaneous hostname lookups fixed.
 * Compiliation fix with some compilers. Reported by Kimiko.
 * ident lookups of new connections was broken for several
   patchlevels.  Works again. Sometimes.
 * Cleaned up some warnings generated by gcc 4.2

   addition of more tests. [SW]

Minor changes:
 * Store a pointer to the start of a player's mailbox in objdata
   instead of the connection struct.
 * Experimental rewrite of hash tables to use the cuckoo hashing
   algorithm, with constant-time lookups even in the worst case.
   (And appears to have generally faster lookup even in normal usage.)
 * Regular expression @sitelocks save the compiled regexp instead of
   recompiling every time the rule is tested.
 * Added %4 to @pageformat, which is the default page message.

Commands:
 * Added @message, which makes it easy to use @chatformat or
   @pageformat via @hooks, or to create your own *format.

Functions:
 * Added message(), the function version of @message.

Fixes:
 * decode64() does better validation of its input. [SW]
 * Various compile fixes reported by Interevis and Kimiko.

Version 1.8.3 patchlevel 4                      July 9, 2007

Major changes:
  * Parts of the build process that used a shell script to regenerate
    certain headers now use perl scripts instead, making them much
    faster. [SW]

Minor changes:
  * The hash tables used by lmath() and html functions now
    use perfect hashing to speed up lookups. [SW]
  * The various slab allocators used by attributes and locks
    and other areas have been replaced with a generic
    slab allocator. Also, many more allocations are handled
    by the new code.
  * Use the writev() system call to send data to unencrypted
    connections in bigger chunks instead of using multiple send()s of
    smaller chunks.
  * New lock types can be added via src/local.c instead of having to
    alter the table in src/locks.c. Based on patch by Talvo.
  * Builtin lock names and default flags are stored in a hash table
    instead of a list. [SW]

Attributes:
  * @chatformat allows you to customize Channel chat messages
    that you see. [GM]

Commands:

    hour. Patch by Talvo.
 
Functions:
  * cond() works like an if, else if, else if ... ncond(),
    condall(), ncondall() also added. [GM]
  * speak() accepts a 1st argument beginning with '&' to use
    an arbitrary speaker name. [GM]
  * New speakpenn() function handles : <pose> in Penn style.
    Suggested by Sketch, patch by Javeln.
  * lmath() accepts dist2d and dist3d. Suggested by Jess.
  * functions(local) returns just local @functions. [SW]
  * New encode64() and decode64() functions convert between
    normal text and base64 encoded text on games that have
    SSL support compiled in. [SW]
  * encrypt() and decrypt() now take an optional 3rd argument
    to control using base 64 encoding. Suggested by Noltar.
 
Fixes:
  * Compile fixes for some linux (And other?) systems that expect
    all libraries to be after source files on the command line
    when linking. Reported by Balerion.

    Nymeria.
  * Fix to fraction() when dealing with numbers that can't
    be fractioned. Discovered by Ashen-Shugar.

  * info_slave requires the presence of the socketpair(2) function.
    It was already using it anyways.
  * Use of some system calls with portability issues encapsulated in
    wrapper functions. [SW]
  * sql() returns error codes directly instead of notifying %!. [SW]

Functions:
  * lattr() and lattrp() take an optional delimiter argument. Suggested
    by Nathan Baum. [SW]
  * New csecs() and msecs() functions, like ctime() and mtime() but
    returning the time in seconds instead of a formatted string. Based on
    a patch by Talvo.
