Penn will compile and run out of the box on FreeBSD, with the caveats
below:

* If you're using a recent version where the clang compiler is
  preferred over gcc, invoke configure like so if it doesn't detect
  clang automatically:

  % CC=clang ./configure

* If you're using an IPv6-enabled install and 'sysctl
  net.inet6.ip6.v6only' prints out 1, you'll have to get a sysadmin to
  change it to 0 or run configure with --disable-ipv6 to allow IPv4
  connections.
