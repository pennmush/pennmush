Penn will compile and run on NetBSD, including OpenSSL
support, with the caveats below. Tested with NetBSD 6.1.5.

Some packages need to be installed via pkgsrc if not already present
on the server:
   perl5, libevent, pcre, optional databases (Note: NetBSD comes with sqlite3 in
   the base system).

If set up to install binary packages, pkg_add them. Otherwise, go to
/usr/pkgsrc and install from source. Locations of the mandatory ones
are:
  devel/libevent
  devel/pcre
  lang/perl5
