Penn will compile and run on NetBSD, including OpenSSL
support, with the caveats below. Tested with NetBSD 6.1.5.

Some packages need to be installed via pkgsrc if not already present
on the server:

   perl, pcre, libevent (Optional but strongly suggested), desired SQL
   database if any (Note: NetBSD comes with sqlite3 in the base
   system).

If set up to install binary packages, pkg_add them. Otherwise, go to
/usr/pkgsrc and install from source. Locations are:
  devel/pcre
  devel/libevent	
  lang/perl5
