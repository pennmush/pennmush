 *
 * \brief Destroying objects and consistency checking.
 *
 * This file has two main parts. One part is the functions for destroying
 * objects and getting objects off of the free list. The major public
 * functions here are do_destroy(), free_get(), and purge().
 *
 * The other part is functions for checking the consistency of the
 * database, and repairing any inconsistencies that are found. The
 * major function in this group is dbck().
 *
 *
 * These lengthy comments are by Ralph Melton, December 1995.
 *
 * First, a discourse on the theory of how we handle destruction.
 *
 * We want to maintain the following invariants:
 * 1. All destroyed objects are on the free list. (linked through the next
 *    fields.)
 * 2. All objects on the free list are destroyed objects.
 * 3. No undestroyed object has its next, contents, location, or home
 *    field pointing to a destroyed object.
 * 4. No object's zone or parent is a destroyed object.
 * 5. No object's owner is a destroyed object.
 *
 * For the sake of efficiency, we allow indirect locks and other locks to
 * refer to destroyed objects; boolexp.c had better be able to cope with
 * these.
 *
 *
 * There are three logically distinct parts to destroying an object:
 *
 * Part 1: we do all the permissions checks, check for the SAFE flag
 * and the override switch, and decide that yes, we are going to destroy
 * this object.
 *
 * Part 2: we eliminate all the links from other objects in the database
 * to this object. This processing may depend on the object's type.
 *
 * Part 3: (logically concurrent with part 2, and must happen together
 * with part 2) Remove any commands the object may have in the queue,
 * free all the storage associated with the object, set the name to
 * 'Garbage', and set this object to be a destroyed object, and put it
 * on the free list. This process is independent of object type.
 *
 * Note that phases 2 and 3 do not have to happen immediately after Phase 1.
 * To allow some delay, we set the object GOING, and then process it on
 * the check that happens every ten minutes.
 *

/* Section I: do_destroy() and related functions. This section is where
 * the human interface of do_destroy() should largely be determined.
 */

/* Methinks it's time to consider human interfaces criteria for destruction
 * as well as to consider the invariants that need to be maintained.
 *
 * My major criteria are these (with no implied ranking, since I haven't
 * decided how they balance out):
 *
 * 1) It's easy to destroy things you intend to destroy.
 *
 * 2) It's easy to correct from destroying things that you don't intend
 * to destroy. This includes both typos and realizing that you didn't mean
 * to destroy that. This principle requires two sub-principles:
 *      a) The player gets notified when something 'important' gets
 *         marked to be destroyed--and gets told .what. is marked.
 *      b) The actual destruction of the important thing is delayed
 *         long enough that you can recover from it.
 *
 * 3) You can't destroy something you don't have the proper privileges to
 * destroy. (Obvious, but still worth writing down.)
 *
 * To try to achieve a reasonable balance between items 1) and 2), we
 * have the following design:
 * Everything is finally destroyed on the second purge after the @destroy
 * command is done, unless it is set !GOING in the meantime.
 * @destroying an object while it is set GOING destroys it immediately.
 *
 * Let me introduce a little jargon for this discussion:
 *      pre-destroying an object == setting it GOING, running the @adestroy.
 *              (Pre-destroying corresponds to phase 1 above.)
 *      purging an object == actually irrevocably making it vanish.
 *              (This corresponds to phases 2 and 3 above.)
 *      undestroying an object == setting it !GOING, etc.
 *
 * We would also like to have an @adestroy attribute that contains
 * code to be executed when the object is destroyed. This is
 * complicated by the fact that the object is going to be
 * destroyed. To work around this, we run the @adestroy when the
 * object is pre-destroyed, not when it's actually purged. This
 * introduces the possibility that the adestroy may be invoked for
 * something that is then undestroyed. To compensate for that, we run
 * the @startup attribute when something is undestroyed.
 *
 * Another issue is how to run the @adestroy for objects that are
 * destroyed as a consequence of other objects being destroyed. For
 * example, when rooms are destroyed, any exits leading from those
 * rooms are also destroyed, and when a player is destroyed, !SAFE
 * objects they own may also be destroyed.
 *
 * To handle this, we do the following:
 * pre-destroying a room pre-destroys all its exits.
 * pre-destroying a player pre-destroys all the objects that will be purged
 * when that player is purged.
 *
 * This requires the following about undestroys:
 * undestroying an exit undestroys its source room.
 * undestroying any object requires undestroying its owner.
 *
 * But it also seems to require the following in order to make '@destroy
 * foo; @undestroy foo' a no-op for all foo:
 * undestroying a room undestroys all its exits.
 * undestroying a player undestroys all its GOING things.
 *
 * Now, consider this scenario:
 * Player A owns room #1. Player B owns exit #2, whose source is room #1.
 * Player B owns thing #3. Player A and player B are both pre-destroyed;
 * none of the objects are set SAFE. Thing #3 is then undestroyed.
 *
 * If you trace through the dependencies, you find that this involves
 * undestroying all the objects, including both players! Is that what
 * we want? It seems to me that it would be very surprising in practice.
 *
 * To reconcile this, we introduce the following compromise.
 * undestroying a room undestroys all exits in the room that are not owned
 *      by a GOING player or set SAFE..
 * undestroying a player undestroys all objects he owns that are not exits
 *      in a GOING room that he does not own.
 *
 * In this way, the propagation of previous scenario would die out at exit
 * #2, which would stay GOING. Metaphorically, there are two 'votes' for
 * its destruction: the destruction of room #1, and the destruction of
 * player B. Undestroying player B by undestroying thing #3 removes one
 * of the 'votes' for exit #2's destruction, but there would still be
 * the vote from room #1.
