Use the links below to view PennMUSH downloads. If you're starting a new PennMUSH installation, you should download either the source code, or Windows executable, for the latest version. If you have an existing PennMUSH installation, you must patch from your current version to each subsequent version, until you're at the latest patchlevel. (If there are many patchlevels between your current game and the latest, you may find it easier to just download the latest version, and copy your database and other important files over.)

You can also view a list of [http://code.google.com/p/pennmush/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AContrib Contrib Patches]. These are submissions which did not make it into vanilla PennMUSH, but which have patches that you may want to use on or modify for your own game. *Note:* These patches may contain bugs, and may not apply cleanly to recent versions of PennMUSH. We recommend that you backup your data first, and read through both the tickets and the code in the patches carefully before applying.
