#summary How to use git to checkout (and commit) to pennmush.

= For Everyone =
{{{
git clone git://github.com/zetafunction/pennmush.git
}}}

= For Committers =

{{{
cd pennmush  # Make sure you're in whatever directory pennmush was cloned into
git svn init --prefix=origin/ -T trunk https://pennmush.googlecode.com/svn
git config svn-remote.svn.fetch trunk:refs/remotes/origin/master
git svn fetch
}}}

= Actually Committing =

Before committing, you'll want to pull your changes into your local master branch somehow. How you do that varies based on your workflow.

Also, if you have several local changes, make sure to squash them into one local commit first with:
{{{
git rebase -i HEAD~n
}}}
where `n` is the number of commits to squash together.

Once that's done:
{{{
git svn rebase
git svn dcommit
}}}

Eventually there will be a helper script for this...

= Notes =
The git repository was populated with:
{{{
git svn clone -s https://pennmush.googlecode.com/svn pennmush-mirror
git remote add origin git@github.com:zetafunction/pennmush.git
git push origin master
}}}

A cronjob runs every 5 minutes pushing new SVN revisions to the git mirror:
{{{
git svn rebase
git push origin master
}}}
