#summary How to build PennMUSH on Windows using the mingw toolchain.

*This page is a work in progress. None of this is guaranteed to work yet.*

= Introduction =

In the future, Visual Studio support will be deprecated and mingw will be the only supported toolchain to build PennMUSH. You have been warned.

= Details =

Install mingw. Install developer toolkit, MSYS base system, gcc, and g++.

Download OpenSSL
{{{
./config
make Makefile openssl.pc libssl.pc libcrypto.pc build_libs build_apps build_tools
make install_docs install_sw  # Fix the names, needed to get around the fact that tests don't build
}}}

Download PCRE
{{{
# It doesn't matter where you choose to install it, as long as you specify the same pah for pennmush ./configure
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install
}}}

In PennMUSH:
{{{
CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib" LIBS="-lws2_32 -lgdi32" ./configure --with-pcre=/usr --disable-info_slave
# This currently breaks due to a missing langinfo.h
make
make install
}}}

Yes, the pcre configure check is so badly broken it's not funny.
