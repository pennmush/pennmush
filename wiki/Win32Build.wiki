#summary How to build PennMUSH on Windows using the mingw toolchain.

*This page is a work in progress. None of this is guaranteed to work yet.*

= Introduction =

In the future, Visual Studio support will be deprecated and mingw will be the only supported toolchain to build PennMUSH. You have been warned.

= Details =

Install mingw. Install developer toolkit, MSYS base system, gcc, and g++.

Download OpenSSL
{{{
./config
make Makefile openssl.pc libssl.pc libcrypto.pc build_libs build_apps build_tools
make install_x install_y  # Fix the names, needed to get around the fact that tests don't build
}}}

Download PCRE
{{{
./configure
make
make install
}}}

In PennMUSH:
{{{
LIBS="-lws2_32 -lgdi32" ./configure
}}}
